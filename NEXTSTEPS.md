Attendance Dashboard
Attendance stats, like assiduity per student, and days with most and less students per weekday, logged max and min per month, per school year.
create a day attendance graph displying the days with the most expected attendance vs the real logged attendance.
expected attendance is calculate based on the scheduled distribution of students per weekday and the real attendance is based on the loggged attendance.

Finance
When adding a payment all that should be necessary to input is the student and the month . the rest the system already knows, can you fix it?

Aditionally on the list of payments, make sure the "mark paid" button works. also for overdue allow the option to mark as paid, like we have for pending payments.
For the overdue payment card of the month, please change the color to red and use the overdue emoji like you have done on the line bellow, make sure it filters correclty on the list.
Add a month filter to the list bellow- to filter the payments for a given month.
