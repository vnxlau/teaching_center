Create a list and fix the issues sequentially:
1. In the Admin account, on the student list the view button on the list does nothing, fix it by opening a student detail page view or modal 
2. In the Admin account, on the student list the edit button on the list does nothing, fix it by opening a student edit page view or modal
3. In the Admin account, on the student list the delete button on the list does nothing, fix it by opening a delete confirmation modal or view
4. In the Admin account, on the student list the column for status doesn't show any values, does the model of student have a status field or something similar?
5. All the students pay according to the number of datys they go to the teaching center per week, example the student can pay from 1 day per week up to all the days of the week ( free pass or full plan), add/create an entity that reflects this practice (it can be called membership plan, service plan or day plan - you choose the best accorging to market practices) each plan can have a price, a name and a number of days the student is allowed to go.
5.1. add the montly due amount to the student entity - each student must be assigned to a plan . add a colunmn for discount allocated to a given student, the discount is then applied to the plan full price, and it results in the student monthly due amount. discount is opcional, being the default value a 0 rate amount.
6. on the finance dashboard make sure there is a section on top of the list search to focus on the current month, example today is 22 of august so it should be August Data example - due payments <A> ( total number <A1> and total amount <A2> ), how many are payed <B> and how many are still due payment <C>. by clicking on each sub section <A1>, <A2>, <B> or <C> go to a view that shows the list of the specific payments - example: list of month payments stil due payment <C>, etc

7. make sure all models in the frontend match the models in the api and do the same for the api models to the sql models
8. make sure no alert windows are shown, use a small/medium modal with modern simple design, if it is to present info - or else if it is just to output an updated like "student created successfully use a notification window on the top right corner or something similar . make sure all views are consistent with the design implemented. 
9. what does the teaching plan actually serves ? for me if you have not found a clear explanation for it - i feel that feature overlaps with the other existing ones. so that section and code can be deprecated
10. the list of the subjects is not returning the subjects but the teaching plans - be sure to have it fixed by listing only the subjects and it's data.
