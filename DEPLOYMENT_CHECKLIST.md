## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Database Deployment
```bash
# Set production database URL
export DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"

# Push schema to production
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Seed production database
npx prisma db seed
```

### Step 2: Application Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or trigger automatic deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] Authentication system works
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] All pages render correctly
- [ ] API routes respond properly
- [ ] File uploads work (if applicable)
- [ ] Email functionality tested
- [ ] Language switching works
- [ ] All user roles can access their respective dashboards

## Production Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:5432/postgres"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-generated-secret-32-characters-min"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"

# Supabase (if using additional features)
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# Optional: Email service
SMTP_HOST="your-smtp-host"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-email"
SMTP_PASS="your-password"
```

## Free Hosting Service Setup

### **Primary Recommendation: Vercel + Supabase**

#### Vercel Setup:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Import your repository
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy with one click

#### Supabase Setup:
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create new project
3. Copy database URL
4. Use Prisma to deploy schema
5. Configure authentication (optional)

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Health Checks
- [ ] Application uptime monitoring set up
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry free tier)
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Database performance monitoring

### User Testing
- [ ] Admin account tested
- [ ] Teacher account tested
- [ ] Student account tested
- [ ] Parent account tested
- [ ] All major workflows verified

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Page load times acceptable (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Images properly optimized
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## Scaling Considerations

### When to Upgrade from Free Tier:

**Vercel Pro ($20/month) when:**
- Bandwidth exceeds 100GB/month
- Need more than 1000 serverless function invocations/day
- Require team collaboration features

**Supabase Pro ($25/month) when:**
- Database size exceeds 500MB
- Need more than 50,000 monthly active users
- Require advanced backup features

### Alternative Free Options:
- **Railway**: All-in-one hosting with $5 monthly credit
- **Render + Neon**: Full-stack with PostgreSQL
- **Netlify + PlanetScale**: Frontend + MySQL alternative

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:

**Build Failures:**
- Check TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check environment variables

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format
- Check Supabase project status
- Confirm Prisma schema is up-to-date

**Authentication Problems:**
- Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
- Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches domain
- Confirm callback URLs configured

**Performance Issues:**
- Enable Vercel Analytics
- Check database query performance
- Optimize images and static assets

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups:
- **Code**: Git repository (GitHub)
- **Database**: Supabase automatic backups (7-day retention)
- **Configuration**: Document all environment variables

### Manual Backup Commands:
```bash
# Export database schema
npx prisma db pull

# Export data (if needed)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql
```

## Success Metrics

### Deployment Success Indicators:
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment
- [ ] All features working in production
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Users can access all functionalities
- [ ] Data integrity maintained
- [ ] Security measures active

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- Monitor error rates (should be <1%)
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor resource usage
- User feedback collection
