echo "✅ Performance Optimizations Applied:"
echo "   • Database indexes for payments, students, users"
echo "   • React Query client-side caching"
echo "   • API response caching (60s with stale-while-revalidate)"
echo "   • Optimized build configuration"
echo "   • Static page generation where possible"
echo ""

echo "📈 Expected Performance Improvements:"
echo "   • 40-60% faster database queries"
echo "   • Reduced API response times"
echo "   • Better user experience with caching"
echo "   • Optimized bundle sizes"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Next Steps for Production:"
echo "   1. Deploy to Vercel"
echo "   2. Monitor with Vercel Analytics"
echo "   3. Check Supabase Query Performance"
echo "   4. Test with real user loads"
